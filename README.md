# Web Development
> ## Animations
>> ### [Elastic Circle](/Web-Development/Animations/Elastic-Circle)
>>> Elasctic circle animation I DID NOT MAKE, I tried to make it on my own and made a sloppier viersion, but the final product is from following the video I found
>>
>>### [Mouse-Particles](/Web-Development/Animations/Mouse-Particles/)
>>> Particles are randomly generated at the cursor, then fall
>
> ## Firefox Extensions
>> ### [CyberPatriot Scoreboard Assistant](/Web-Development/Firefox-Extensions/CyberPatriot-Scoreboard-Assistant/)
>>> Lets you select scoreboard through right click (context) menus
>>>
>>> **Ideas**
>>>
>>> - make it so that you can move the scoreboards around after they are added, but more can be added after moving them around
>>> - add a button in the context menus that lets you delete a scoreborad that has been added to the viewing panel
>>
>> ### [Mouse Customizer](/Web-Development/Firefox-Extensions/Mouse-Customizer)
>>> Firefox extention that lets you customize your mouse
>>>
>>> **Ideas**
>>> - Let use upload a custom picture for the mouse if they want
>>> - For certain affects, let the user customize the effect some (change the values in the formulas if there are any, or change something to a custom image/color)
>>> - Let the user customize an outline of some sort of the mouse
>>> - Make the outline ALSO outline custom mouse images if they are used
>
